# Water-Quality-Data-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning

Introduction

Safe and accessible water is a critical factor in public health, influencing not only drinking water but also various aspects like domestic use, food production, and recreational activities. Addressing water supply, sanitation, and effective water resource management can lead to economic growth and significantly contribute to poverty reduction.

Contaminated water and inadequate sanitation are closely associated with the spread of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio. Insufficient water and sanitation services, particularly in healthcare facilities, expose individuals to preventable health risks. Globally, a significant proportion of patients—15%—acquire infections during hospital stays, with the risk being even higher in low-income countries.

Inspired by the crucial role of water quality in public health, this project utilizes a Water Quality dataset to explore and understand the factors contributing to safe, potable water. Machine learning techniques are applied to distinguish between potable and non-potable water based on various water quality features.

Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following features:

ph: pH of water (scale of 0 to 14).

Hardness: Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.

Solids: Total dissolved solids in ppm.

Chloramines: Amount of Chloramines in ppm.

Sulfate: Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L.

Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm.

Organic_carbon: Amount of organic carbon in ppm.

Trihalomethanes: Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L.

Turbidity: Measure of the light-emitting property of water in NTU.

Potability: Indicates if water is safe for human consumption (Potable - 1, Not potable – 0).

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze the Water Quality dataset and develop a model capable of accurately distinguishing between potable and non-potable water based on the provided features.
